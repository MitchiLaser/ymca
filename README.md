# Yet another Multi Channel Analyzer (YMCA)

> "It's fun to play with the YMCA!"

YMCA is a proof of concept multi channel analyzer (MCA) for the RedPitaya (RP).
It is based on the MCPHA application, written by Pavel Demin, and uses the server application he provides to retrieve the data from the analog inputs.
